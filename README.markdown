# rbenv.vim

This simple plugin provides a `:Rbenv` command that wraps `!rbenv` with tab
complete.  It also tells recent versions of [vim-ruby][] where your Ruby
installs are located, so that it can set `'path'` and [`'tags'`][rbenv-ctags]
in your Ruby buffers to reflect the nearest `.ruby-version` file.

Bonus: [projectile.vim][] support for rbenv plugins.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-rbenv.git

## FAQ

> My Vim insists on using the system Ruby.

You're using zsh on OS X, aren't you? You've got multiple options here.
You can

* Move `/etc/zshenv` to `/etc/zshrc`
* Set your `PATH` in `~/.zshenv` instead of `~/.zshrc`.
